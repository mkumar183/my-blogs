<p>There is a good corrolary between time and space that are building blocks of this universe with CPU and RAM of the world of computer science. In recent cloud terminology these are also referred as Compute and Storage. These are really fundamental building blocks of computers and that of programming. In programming you are constantly thinking of resources and cost. Optimizing program means optimizing how much compute your program uses and how much memory (space) it consumes either temporarily or permanently to store the information.</p>
