##### CPU and RAM (Time and Space) 
There is a good corrolary between time and space that are building blocks of this universe with CPU and RAM of the world of computer science. In recent cloud terminology these are also referred as Compute and Storage. These are really fundamental building blocks of computers and that of programming. In programming you are constantly thinking of resources and cost. Optimizing program means optimizing how much compute your program uses and how much memory (space) it consumes either temporarily or permanently to store the information. 

##### Input, Processing and Output 
The other concept you should understand is any computer program fundamentally deals with these three elements. It has certain input, it does certain processing and it produces certain output. Inputs can be directly given to your program or it can come from disk or from a database and so on. Processing is what fundamentally your program does. Output is the outcome of the process. It could be value returned from a program or it could be a value that is written to a file on a disk or it could be a value updated in a database. 
factorial(n) is an example of a simple program that takes n as input, does the computation and then returns thecomputed value as output. 

##### Network, Client, Server, API, EndPoint 
These are important concepts when it comes to dealing with a network of computers. So far what we spoke are true for a standalone computer. But computers seldom operate in isolation. They are constantly communicating with each other. Communication between two computers require one to receive information and then to respond back with the output. When two computers communication they require authentication and authorization. Computers on internet are provided with addresses called as IP Address or DSN and they listen on certain port. These IP Addresses and ports are then referred to as endpoints. Not all IP addresses are available in public domains. So there are colonies of computers and they are allowed to communicate within those colonies (called VPN). When computer can communicate with public internet then it becomes available to all other computers. 

##### Authorization and Authentication
When computers are communicating over the internet it becomes important that there are some basic protocols and security around these. So that someone cannot do what is not desired / expected. In order to enable these there are various types of authorization and authentication protocols that have beeen standardised. Oauth1.0 and Oauth2.0 are such protocols. We will talk more about these later on. 

##### Cloud 
Now comes more advancement in the systems where not every organization wants to maintain their own hardware. So for this purpose they try to lease the hardware from another vendor who is then maintaining these hardware for several vendors and tries to optimise the cost across these usage. This brought a rather bigger evolution in the systems since cloud providers started providing interesting options to host very small to very large infrastructure on just few mouse clicks. They also started providing robust security mechanisms. So work that was earlier done by system administrators earlier now moved to cloud operations team who instead of managing their own data centers started managing infrastructure over the cloud. 

##### Virtualization 


##### Multi-Tenant / SaaS Based Applications vs On Premise Applications
