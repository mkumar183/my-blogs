<ul>
  <li>To know what we really are as Soul</li>
  <li>Self-realization (soul realization)</li>
  <li>Knowing what is God</li>
  <li>To change ourselves towards better being</li>
  <li>To attain a state in which we are happy forever</li>
  <li>To liberate ourselves from senses</li>
  <li>To become one with all</li>
  <li>To become one with God</li>
  <li>To gain supreme consciousness</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one thing that is common in all this. That is change. 
And this change is in yourself. This change is towards becoming 
more humble, less selfish, more altrustic person. This is also 
same as soul realization or God realization.</p>
