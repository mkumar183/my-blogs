> A program is a series of transitions among states.

Debugging is process of examining that transition in states. 

> Logs should contain sufficient information to help with the reconstruction of state transitions.

> Itâ€™s the same for logs, developers only need to log when critical state transition happens, and logs should contain the key characteristics of the current state and the reason for transition.

In case of a problem how your logs can pinpoint you to smallest piece of code or process that helps you in debugging and resolving.

When to log: Log when critical state transition happens.
What to log: Key characteristics of the current state and the reason for state transition.
Who to log: Log at the right layer of abstraction that has sufficient context.
How many logs: Estimate the X factor(X as in, # of logs = X * # of work items + constants), and tune it to a budget but helpful value.

Make proper use of Log Levels in order to contain logs.
