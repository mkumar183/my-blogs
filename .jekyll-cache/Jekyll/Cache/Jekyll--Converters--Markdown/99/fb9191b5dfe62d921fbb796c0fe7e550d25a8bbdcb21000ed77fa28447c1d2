I"ú<p>I had a problem where jupyter notebook command gives error that command not found.</p>

<p>then i found out that this shell exists in a directory that is not on $PATH 
variable value.</p>

<p>There are several ways to fix it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>i could add this path to $PATH and set that in my profile that gets executed
every time i create a new terminal window. This is standard approach.</li>
  <li>I create a text file. put the commands that i want to run in that and i copied
this file into one of the directory that is already on the path. Gave chmod 777
permission to this file and voila now i can type name of this script from anywhere
and it will execute my command.</li>
</ol>

<p>i created a script called run-jupyter and copied to /usr/local/bin</p>
