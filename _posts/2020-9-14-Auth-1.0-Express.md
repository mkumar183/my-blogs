##### Difference between Oauth 1.0 and 2.0 
OAuth 1.0 only handled web workflows, but OAuth 2.0 considers non-web clients as well. Better separation of duties. Handling resource requests and handling user authorization can be decoupled in OAuth 2.0. Basic signature workflow.

##### Introduce middleware
We introduced express middleware in order to perform this authentication
prior to calling the client application. In our case client application
is rendered at server side so we did not have to pass any tokens
to this application. 

##### How Oath Signatures are Generated 
Oath signature is generated based on below method: <br>

```
   const oauth_signature = crypto  
     .createHmac('sha1', signing_key) 
     .update(signature_base_string) 
     .digest() 
     .toString('base64'); 
```

##### Full code including constructing base string
```
    const encodedKey = encodeURIComponent(k);
    const encodedValue = escape(ordered[k]); // in our case had to skip certain elements 

    // in our case had to re-encode certain parameters
    if (encodedParameters === '') {
      encodedParameters += encodeURIComponent(`${encodedKey}=${encodedValue}`);
    } else {
      encodedParameters += encodeURIComponent(`&${encodedKey}=${encodedValue}`);
    }

  const method = 'POST';
  const base_url = 'http://localhost:3000/';
  const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(base_url);
  const signature_base_string = `${method}&${encodedUrl}&${encodedParameters}`;

  const secret_key = `yoursecretkey`; // this needs to be moved to config later
  const signing_key = `${secret_key}&`; //as token is missing in our case.
  const crypto = require('crypto');

  const oauth_signature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha1', signing_key)
    .update(signature_base_string)
    .digest()
    .toString('base64');
```

Its important here to know how the signature_base_string is formed. 
In our case, this was formed by http method (POST or GET), url that 
is to be called (redirect url) and then all the parameters that 
form post is doing. How signature is constructed should be published by the receiver.
This was the main issue in our implementation. There were several
parameters that were re-encoded and that ended up inserting additional 
characters. 

Below url helped me in doing some quick experiments and trying to match 
string used by calling application.

##### How to match base string 
In order match base string, i used vimdiff. I put two windows side by side
and ensure their width was same by matching first line (fortunately 
first line was matching). Then we matched line by line (since its all wrapped)
so this was a laborious exercise. But by looking at each parameters we could 
figure out where the problems were. Using above url we encoded twice and checked
if it was a double encoding problem. 

##### escape function 
This function replaces colon (:) by %3A.
